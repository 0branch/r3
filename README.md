# Rebol [R3] Source Code Distribution

Purpose of this **Rebol fork** is to push the origial [Carl's source](https://github.com/rebol/rebol) to be usable at least like Rebol 2,
but keep the source code clean and project easy to build.

You may want to check [Ren-C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c) and [Red](https://github.com/red/red) projects,
if you are looking for other _Rebol like languages_.

And or [Shinxin's fork](https://github.com/zsx/r3), which is much more ahead than this fork
as it contains modifications from Atronix and Saphirion. But with a cost that the code structure is not clean as the original.
