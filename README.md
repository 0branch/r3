# Rebol [R3] Source Code Distribution

Purpose of this **Rebol fork** is to push the origial [Carl's source](https://github.com/rebol/rebol) to be usable at least like Rebol 2,
but keep the source code clean and project easy to build.

### Issues reporting

I was quite a long time using official Rebol issues repository https://github.com/rebol/rebol-issues
but because nobody really cares about official Rebol and this repository and I was not allowed even to tag my own issues, which I suppose to be fixed in my branch, I copied existing issues to my own repository, which is here: https://github.com/Oldes/Rebol-issues

### Other Rebol related projects

You may want to check [Ren-C](https://github.com/metaeducation/ren-c), [Red](https://github.com/red/red) and [Boron](http://urlan.sourceforge.net/boron/) projects,
if you are looking for other _Rebol like languages_.

There is also [Shinxin's fork](https://github.com/zsx/r3), which I was initially using for _chery-picking_,
as it contains modifications from Atronix and Saphirion. But its use is now limited as it depends on non-public modules and also there is not much life visible recently.
